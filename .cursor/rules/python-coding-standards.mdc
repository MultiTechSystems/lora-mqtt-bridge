# Python Coding Standards

## Type Annotations

- ALWAYS add typing annotations to each function or class
- Include return types when necessary
- Use `List`, `Dict`, `Optional` from typing for Python 3.8 compatibility (mLinux 6)
- Can use `list`, `dict`, `|` for Python 3.10+ only (mLinux 7, Ubuntu)

## Docstrings

- Add descriptive docstrings to all Python functions and classes
- Use PEP 257 convention for docstring formatting
- Update existing docstrings if needed

## Comments

- Keep any comments that exist in a file
- Do not remove existing comments when making changes

## Code Style

- Use Ruff for code style consistency
- Run `ruff check src tests` before committing
- Run `ruff format src tests` for formatting

## Project Structure

- Clear project structure with separate directories for source code, tests, docs, and config
- Modular design with distinct files for models, services, controllers, and utilities
- Create `__init__.py` files in all Python package directories

## Error Handling

- Robust error handling and logging, including context capture
- Use structured logging with syslog for gateway deployments
